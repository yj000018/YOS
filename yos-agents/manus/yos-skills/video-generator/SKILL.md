# Video Generation

## Workflow Overview

1. **Phase 1: Initial** → Gather requirements, STOP for user confirmation
2. **Phase 2: Global Definitions** → Define style, characters, voices, BGM (text only, no images)
3. **Phase 3: Clip & BGM Planning** → Segment into clips, plan each clip, and create the final BGM blueprint
4. **Phase 4: Reference Images** → Generate reference images (MANDATORY before Phase 5)
5. **Phase 5: Execution** → Purely execute the blueprint: generate keyframes, videos, and all audio assets

---

## Critical Rules (MUST Follow)

Before starting, memorize these non-negotiable rules:

1. **[PHASE 1 STOP]** If the user has not explicitly specified certain details, MUST ask questions to gather the missing information. DO NOT assume or guess—always ask the user for clarification. Never proceed without explicit user confirmation.

2. **[DETAILED VIDEO PROMPT]** Video prompts must include detailed transition_description (2-4 sentences). One-line prompts are insufficient.

3. **[KEYFRAME DIFFERENCE]** Last keyframe must show interpolatable change from first keyframe: subject position/pose, subject state (open/close, appear/disappear), or composition change. Subtle-only changes (lighting, background) while subject stays static cause unnatural video motion.

4. **[PHASE 4 MANDATORY]** MUST generate reference images before keyframes. Never skip Phase 4.

5. **[ASPECT RATIO]** ALL keyframes must use 16:9 or 9:16, and must be upright (not rotated). Never generate 1:1 or other ratios.

6. **[NO TTS FOR ON-SCREEN]** Never use TTS for on-screen dialogue or singing. Video model generates audio with lip sync.

7. **[NARRATION PER SPAN]** Generate TTS per narration span, not all at once. For audio-visual sync scenes, prefer one narration per clip; for continuous commentary over B-roll or montage, a span may cover multiple consecutive clips.

8. **[AUDIO MIXING]** When combining audio tracks (video audio, narration, BGM), preserve ALL tracks—overlay, never replace. Narration must be clearly audible and maintain consistent volume across all clips.

## Image Generation Tools

| Tool | Use When |
|------|----------|
| `generate_image` | Create new images (with or without references) |
| `generate_image_variation` | Edit existing images |

---

## Phase 1: Initial

### Gather Information

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Purpose | Goal and target audience |
| Narrative arc | Story structure and key points |
| Duration | Total length in seconds |
| Aspect ratio | 16:9 or 9:16 only |
| Visual style | Sub-genre aesthetic (e.g., "Makoto Shinkai anime", "Pixar 3D") |
| Reference materials | Reference videos, images, brand guidelines |
| Language | For dialogue and narration |
| Recurring elements | Characters/objects with appearance descriptions |
| Dialogue/singing needs | On-screen character audio |
| Narration needs | Off-screen narrator (gender, tone, pace) |
| BGM requirements | Music style, mood, instruments |

### Five-Dimension Expert Framework

Use these perspectives to guide your questions:

| Dimension | Expert Role | Key Questions |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Strategy & Audience** | Creative Director | Who is this for? What's the goal? What action should viewers take? |
| **Narrative & Structure** | Screenwriter | What's the story? Key moments? Emotional arc? |
| **Visual Style** | Director + Art Director | What look and feel? Reference videos/images? Color mood? |
| **Shot Execution** | Cinematographer | Any specific shots in mind? Product hero shots needed? |
| **Sound Design** | Sound Designer | Voiceover? Music mood? Dialogue? Sound effects? |

Ask questions across all dimensions. Prioritize based on user's initial description.

> **[MANDATORY STOP - DO NOT PROCEED WITHOUT USER CONFIRMATION]**
> Summarize gathered information and wait for user confirmation before Phase 2.

---

## Phase 2: Global Definitions (Text Only)

### Visual Style Specification

Define these 4 dimensions (applied to primary reference images in Phase 4):

| Dimension | Example Values |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Sub-genre** | Makoto Shinkai anime, Pixar 3D, cyberpunk noir |
| **Rendering + Line** | 2D hand-drawn with thick outlines, 3D cel-shading |
| **Color + Lighting** | High saturation neon, soft diffused natural light |
| **Detail density** | Minimalist, highly detailed backgrounds |

**Example specification:**

```
Sub-genre: Cyberpunk anime
Rendering + Line: 2D digital painting, thin glowing outlines
Color + Lighting: High saturation neon (pink, cyan, purple), dark backgrounds, rim lighting
Detail density: Highly detailed backgrounds, moderate character detail
```

### Recurring Elements

For each character/object:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| unique_identifier | Name for reference |
| appearance | Text description for prompts |
| outfit_description | Clothing/accessories (characters) |
| language | Spoken/sung language (if applicable) |
| mechanical_properties | Physical behavior (if applicable) |

### Voice Profiles

- **On-screen**: From character definitions (dialogue/singing)
- **Off-screen narrator**: name, gender, tone, pace, language

### BGM Source Decision

| Scenario | BGM Source |
|----------|------------|
| Music video / diegetic music (visible source) | **Embedded** (in video prompt) |
| Background mood music | **Separate** (Phase 5 BGM Generation) |
| No music | **None** |

**If Separate**, define global BGM properties (consistent across all clips):
- Genre & style
- Tempo & rhythm (BPM) — default locked; vary only if arrangement specifically requires tempo change
- Key & scale — default locked; vary only if arrangement specifically requires modulation
- Core instrumentation — the full sonic palette available for the track (e.g., `acoustic guitar, ukulele, piano, brushed drums`); not all instruments must play in every section
- Soundscape/ambiance
- Production quality

---

## Phase 3: Clip & BGM Planning

### Segmentation Rules

- Clips: **4, 6, or 8 seconds only**
- Each clip: **one action, one scene**

### Per-Clip Specification

| Field | Values |
|-------|--------|
| **narrative_purpose** | establish / develop / climax / resolve / transition / supplementary (product shot, detail, reaction, insert, B-roll, POV) |
| **pacing** | slow / moderate / fast |
| **scene** | Environment description |
| **content_action** | Subject + action + trajectory |
| **transition_description** | **[REQUIRED]** Detailed transition process. Must include: subject appearance, movement trajectory, state changes, existence statements. 2-4 sentences minimum. |
| **duration** | 4 / 6 / 8 |
| **camera_movement** | static / pan / tilt / dolly / zoom / crane / arc / handheld |
| **first_keyframe_framing** | Shot size + angle + composition |
| **first_keyframe_visible_content** | What's visible |
| **last_keyframe_framing** | Shot size + angle + composition |
| **last_keyframe_visible_content** | What's visible |
| **last_keyframe_edit_from_first** | yes / no (see decision table below) |
| **inter_clip_boundary** | continuous / scene_cut |
| **first_keyframe_reuse** | yes / no |
| **last_keyframe_required** | yes / no |
| **on_screen_dialogue** | "Name: text" or "Name: [lyrics] (style)" or None |
| **sound_effects** | Sources or None |
| **bgm_source** | embedded / separate / none |
| **bgm_cue** | If embedded: style, BPM, instruments. If separate: mood/emotion, arrangement state (sparse/moderate/dense/full), density & brightness. Optionally include per-clip overrides for default-locked dimensions: active instruments (subset of core instrumentation), tempo change, key modulation. Adjacent clips MAY share identical bgm_cue values when their emotional intent is the same. |
| **narration_budget** | Max TTS duration (seconds). See Narration Planning. |
| **narration_cue** | Narrator text, "continues", or None. See Narration Planning. |

### Field Dependencies

- `inter_clip_boundary = continuous` → next clip's `first_keyframe_reuse = yes`
- `first_keyframe_reuse = yes` → previous clip must have `last_keyframe_required = yes`

### Keyframe Difference Requirement

When planning `last_keyframe_visible_content`, ensure interpolatable change from `first_keyframe_visible_content`:
- Subject position/pose change (movement, rotation, action)
- Subject state change (open/close, appear/disappear, expression)
- Composition change from camera movement (zoom, pan result)

> **[WARNING]** Avoid last keyframes with only lighting or background changes while subject remains static—this causes unnatural video motion.

### Decision: last_keyframe_edit_from_first

| Camera Movement | First & Last Keyframe Overlap? | Set to |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|--------|
| static, small pan/tilt, zoom | Yes (same scene area) | `yes` |
| large pan, dolly, tracking, crane, arc | No (different area) | `no` |

### transition_description Requirements

This field directly becomes part of the video prompt. **The more detailed, the better.**

**Must include:**
1. **Subject appearance**: Key visual features that must remain consistent throughout
2. **Movement trajectory**: How subject/camera moves through space and time
3. **State changes**: How objects/environment change over the duration
4. **Existence statements**: What is present throughout (prevents pop-in/pop-out)

**Length guideline:** 2-4 sentences minimum. One-line descriptions are insufficient.

### transition_description Examples

| Insufficient | Sufficient |
|--------------|------------|
| "Open box revealing jar" | "The frosted glass jar with gold lid is inside the box from the start, hidden by the closed cream-colored lid. Elegant hands with manicured nails lift the lid upward smoothly. As the lid rises, the jar gradually comes into view - first the gold cap edge, then the full jar nestled in champagne velvet." |
| "Person walks left to right" | "Woman in white dress with brown hair starts at left edge of frame, walks steadily rightward at moderate pace, maintaining upright posture, reaches right edge by end of clip." |
| "Light turns on" | "Room starts in complete darkness. Light gradually increases from the ceiling fixture at center, warm yellow glow spreading outward across the wooden furniture until fully illuminated." |

### Physical Consistency Check

| Movement | Constraint |
|----------|------------|
| Pan/Tilt/Zoom | Camera fixed, content within rotational/zoom range |
| Dolly/Tracking/Crane | Content physically traversable within duration |
| Arc | Subject centered in both keyframes, environment allows orbit |
| Handheld | Similar to Dolly but allows irregularity |
| Combined | Must satisfy ALL involved movement constraints |

**Common Mistakes:**

| Mistake | Correction |
|---------|------------|
| "Pan from corridor entrance to middle" | Use "dolly forward" |
| First: room A, Last: room B | Split into two clips |
| 6-second clip covering 100 meters | Extend duration or reduce distance |

### Narration Planning

**Goal**: Design narration text that fits comfortably within the video timeline and sounds natural at TTS output speed.

- Too much text → rushed, unnaturally fast delivery.
- Too little text → sparse, disconnected feel.
- No gaps between segments → suffocating, no breathing room.
- Text length is the primary lever at planning stage; speaking rate and pauses are fine-tuned later via SSML.

**Step 1: Plan narration segments**

Based on the narrative arc and all clips' content, determine how many narration segments the video needs and what each segment conveys.

Then assign each segment to clip(s), considering:
- **Descriptive narration** (narration directly describes on-screen action) → align the segment to a single clip for tight audio-visual sync.
- **Commentary narration** (narration provides context or explanation independent of specific on-screen action) → the segment may span multiple consecutive clips if the thought is semantically unbreakable.

Some clips may have no narration at all. When spanning multiple clips, write the full text on the first clip's `narration_cue` and mark "continues" on subsequent clips.

**Step 2: Calculate narration budget**

`narration_budget` = total spanned clip duration (in seconds)

This is the maximum allowed TTS audio duration for this narration span. Write it in the `narration_budget` field of the first clip in the span.

**Step 3: Write narration text within budget**

Estimate the text's natural speaking duration to ensure it fits within the budget. Rough reference for sanity-checking:
- CJK languages (Chinese, Japanese, Korean): ~4 characters/sec
- Alphabetic languages (English, Spanish, French, etc.): ~2.5 words/sec
- When unsure about a specific language, err on the side of shorter text — a slightly short narration is always better than a rushed one.

### [MANDATORY] Reference Image Requirements

After all clips planned, list required reference images:

| Element | Clips Using It | Required Images |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| (name) | Clip X (MS), Clip Y (CU) | Full body, Face close-up |

> **[WARNING]** Only generate what clips actually need. Do NOT generate all angles by default.

### [MANDATORY FINAL STEP] BGM Emotional Arc Blueprint

After all clips have been planned, and ONLY if `bgm_source` was set to `separate`, you MUST perform the following summary task. This creates the definitive blueprint for the music.

- **Action**: Read the full clip plan you just created.
- **Task**: Create a precise, second-by-second **Emotional Arc List** in a markdown table. For each clip, calculate the start and end time based on its duration. Extract the `bgm_cue` for that time segment. **Merge consecutive clips into a single row if they share identical `bgm_cue` values** (same mood/emotion, arrangement state, and density & brightness).
- **Output Example**:

| Time Segment  | Mood/Emotion          | Arrangement State |
|---------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| `[00:00-00:16]` | `gentle, relaxed`     | `sparse`          |
| `[00:16-00:22]` | `energetic, excited`  | `moderate`        |
| `...`           | `...`                 | `...`             |

This concludes Phase 3. You now have a complete blueprint for the video and its BGM.

## [MANDATORY] Phase 4: Reference Image Generation

**MANDATORY. Do not skip to Phase 5.**

### Generation Order

**Step 1: Primary reference (visual anchor)**
- Tool: `generate_image` (no references)
- Prompt MUST include: **Full Visual Style Specification** from Phase 2 + element description
- White background
- Ends with "no text, no watermarks, no logos, no labels, no annotations"

**Step 2: Additional angles/shots**
- Tool: `generate_image_variation`
- References: [primary_ref, other_refs...]
- Prompt: "Edit this image: [changes only]"
- White background
- Ends with "no text, no watermarks, no logos, no labels, no annotations"

> **[WARNING]** Never generate additional refs without using primary ref as reference.

---

## Phase 5: Execution

### Global Rules

> **[CRITICAL]** ALL keyframes: aspect ratio from Phase 1 (16:9 or 9:16). Never 1:1.

### First Keyframe

```
first_keyframe_reuse = yes → Use previous clip's last keyframe (no generation)
first_keyframe_reuse = no  → Generate new keyframe
```

**If generating first keyframe:**
- [ ] Tool: `generate_image`
- [ ] References: Appropriate Phase 4 images
- [ ] Aspect ratio: 16:9 or 9:16
- [ ] Prompt includes:
  - [ ] Visual style (sub-genre + key characteristics, brief)
  - [ ] Scene environment
  - [ ] Framing (shot size + angle + lens)
  - [ ] Visible content
  - [ ] Subject appearance + outfit
- [ ] Prompt ends with: "no text, no watermarks, no logos, no annotations"

### Last Keyframe

```
last_keyframe_required = no  → Skip
last_keyframe_required = yes:
  last_keyframe_edit_from_first = yes → Edit mode
  last_keyframe_edit_from_first = no  → Generate mode
```

**If EDIT mode:**
- [ ] Tool: `generate_image_variation`
- [ ] References: [first_keyframe, Phase 4 refs...]
- [ ] Prompt: "Edit this image: [changes only]"
- [ ] Do NOT repeat unchanged elements

**If GENERATE mode:**
- [ ] Tool: `generate_image`
- [ ] References: [first_keyframe (scene ref), Phase 4 refs...]
- [ ] Aspect ratio: 16:9 or 9:16
- [ ] Prompt includes:
  - [ ] Visual style (brief)
  - [ ] Last keyframe framing + visible content
  - [ ] Subject appearance and end state
  - [ ] "Same location/environment as reference"
- [ ] Prompt ends with: "no text, no watermarks, no logos, no annotations"

### Consistency Checklist (Easily Overlooked)

When generating last keyframe, verify:
- [ ] **Interpolatable change**: Clear difference in subject position/pose, state, or composition (not just lighting/background)
- [ ] Same lighting direction and shadows as first keyframe
- [ ] Same color temperature (warm/cool)
- [ ] Same depth of field
- [ ] Same outfit, facial features, body proportions
- [ ] Environment details consistent

### Video Generation

**Video prompt should be detailed.** Even with keyframes, video models may drift during generation.

**Prompt includes:**
- [ ] Visual style (brief)
- [ ] Pacing (slow / moderate / fast)
- [ ] **transition_description** from Phase 3 (detailed, 2-4 sentences)
- [ ] **Subject appearance** (key features for consistency)
- [ ] **Scene environment** (brief)
- [ ] Audio (see below)

**Audio in prompt:**

| Type | Include |
|------|---------|
| On-screen dialogue | "Name says: text" with tone, language |
| On-screen singing | "Name sings: [lyrics]" with style, language |
| Sound effects | Source + quality |
| Embedded BGM | Style, BPM, instruments, mood |

**Prompt ending by bgm_source:**
- embedded → (no ending, music described in prompt body)
- separate/none → End with "No background music."

**Example (music video with embedded BGM):**
```
Hatsune Miku center stage, singing in Japanese with sweet electronic voice: 
"ラララ、光の中で踊り出す", energetic J-pop at 140 BPM with synthesizer, 
crowd cheering, concert atmosphere
```

> **[CRITICAL]** Never use TTS for on-screen dialogue/singing. Video model generates audio with lip sync.

### BGM Generation (if bgm_source = separate)

**[CRITICAL] The BGM blueprint (Emotional Arc List) was already created at the end of Phase 3. Your task here is pure execution.**

**Step 1: Retrieve the Blueprint**

- **Action**: Locate the Emotional Arc List you created at the end of Phase 3.

**Step 2: Generate the BGM Prompt**

- **Action**: Read the `music-prompter` skill to apply its 9-dimension framework and syntax.
- **Task**: Use the **Emotional Arc List as the SOLE SOURCE OF TRUTH** for the arrangement breakdown section of the prompt. Translate each row of the table into a timestamped section in the prompt.
- **Process**:
    1.  Start with the **Global Directives**: `Instrumental only, no vocals. Create a [Total Duration]s track at [BPM] BPM.` (Get Total Duration and BPM from the plan).
    2.  Write the **Core DNA**: Use the global BGM properties defined in Phase 2.
    3.  Write the **Arrangement Breakdown**: Translate **each row** of the Emotional Arc List into a `[mm:ss - mm:ss]` section.

**[MANDATORY]** The final BGM prompt MUST reflect the exact timing and emotional cues from the Emotional Arc List. Do NOT use a generic template.

**Step 3: Generate the Audio**

- **Action**: Use the `generate_music` tool with the prompt created in the previous step.
- **Task**: For duration and multi-clip strategy, follow the rules in the `music-prompter` skill. Do not guess.

> **[WARNING]** DO NOT use Python to generate music.

### Narration Generation (if narration exists)

> **[WARNING]** Generate **per narration span**, not all at once. A narration span may cover one or multiple consecutive clips.

- **[MANDATORY]** Read the `tts-skill` for SSML construction and tool usage guidance.
- Same voice profile across all clips.

### Audio Summary

| Type | Method | Output |
|------|--------|--------|
| On-screen dialogue/singing | Video model | Embedded |
| Sound effects | Video model | Embedded |
| Embedded BGM | Video model | Embedded |
| Separate BGM | `generate_music` | Separate track |
| Narration | TTS (per narration span) | Separate track |

### Audio Mixing (Final Assembly)

When combining multiple audio sources:

| Track | Source |
|-------|--------|
| Video audio | Embedded in video clips (dialogue, sound effects, embedded BGM) |
| Narration | TTS generated (off-screen narrator) |
| Separate BGM | Generated via `generate_music` |

**[CRITICAL]** Mixing rules:
- Preserve ALL audio tracks—overlay, never replace one with another
- Narration must be clearly audible—not drowned out by other tracks
- Narration volume must be consistent across all clips
